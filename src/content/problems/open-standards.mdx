## The Question

How do we leverage and design open standards to get real work done?

## Why It Matters

Standards promise interoperability, but the graveyard of failed standards is vast. The successful ones share something: they solve real problems for real users, not just satisfy committee requirements. Understanding when and how to use standards - and when to avoid them - is a crucial skill.

## Current Thinking

Effective use of standards requires pragmatism:

1. **Adopt strategically** - Use standards where interoperability matters
2. **Implement incrementally** - Full compliance isn't always necessary
3. **Contribute upstream** - Shape standards to match real needs
4. **Know when to deviate** - Standards shouldn't block progress

The goal is interoperability, not compliance for its own sake.

## Open Subquestions

- How do we evaluate which standards are worth adopting?
- When should we participate in standards development vs. just implementing?
- How do we handle the gap between standards and real-world requirements?
- How do we balance standard compliance with user experience?
