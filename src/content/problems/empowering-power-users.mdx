## The Question

How do we empower bioinformatics power users with a bioinformatic platform designed for bench scientists?

## Why It Matters

Platforms like Galaxy were designed to make bioinformatics accessible to bench scientists. But as those scientists grow in expertise, or as computational biologists join the community, they hit walls. The same guardrails that help beginners can frustrate experts. Losing power users means losing contributors, tool developers, and community leaders.

## Current Thinking

The solution likely involves escape hatches at every level:

1. **API-first design** - Everything the UI does should be scriptable
2. **Workflow abstractions** - Power users think in pipelines, not clicks
3. **Extension points** - Let experts extend without forking
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Simple by default, powerful when needed

## Open Subquestions

- How do we identify when a user is ready for more power?
- What's the right balance between UI and programmatic access?
- How do we keep power-user features from cluttering the beginner experience?
- Can we make the transition from GUI to API gradual rather than cliff-like?
