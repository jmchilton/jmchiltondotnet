## The Question

What are some great cocktails?

## Why It Matters

A well-made cocktail is a small pleasure that rewards attention and craft. Understanding what makes a drink work - balance, technique, quality ingredients - applies beyond the bar. Plus, it's fun.

## Current Thinking

See my [cocktails page](/cocktails) for current favorites and recipes.

Great cocktails share characteristics:

1. **Balance** - Sweet, sour, strong, weak in harmony
2. **Quality ingredients** - You taste what goes in
3. **Proper technique** - Shaking vs stirring matters
4. **Presentation** - The experience starts with the eyes

## Open Subquestions

- What classics deserve more attention?
- How do you adapt recipes to available ingredients?
- What's the minimum home bar for maximum range?
- How do seasonal ingredients change the cocktail calendar?
