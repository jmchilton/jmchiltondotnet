## The Question

How do we make agentic development on large legacy systems effective and maintainable?

## Why It Matters

AI coding assistants are transforming software development, but most demos show greenfield projects. Real-world impact comes from improving existing systems - the ones with millions of lines of code, implicit conventions, and decades of accumulated decisions. Making AI effective here is harder but more valuable.

## Current Thinking

Effective agentic development on legacy systems requires:

1. **Context management** - AI needs to understand not just code, but history and intent
2. **Safe iteration** - Changes must be testable and reversible
3. **Convention detection** - Following existing patterns, not introducing new ones
4. **Incremental adoption** - Can't rewrite everything at once

The goal isn't AI replacing developers, but AI amplifying developers who already understand the system.

## Open Subquestions

- How much context does an AI need to make good decisions in a legacy codebase?
- How do we prevent AI from introducing inconsistencies with existing patterns?
- What's the right human-AI division of labor for different types of changes?
- How do we build trust in AI-generated changes to critical systems?
