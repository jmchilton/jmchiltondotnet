## The Question

How do we keep Galaxy alive and funded?

## Why It Matters

Galaxy serves thousands of researchers worldwide, enabling science that wouldn't otherwise happen. But open source infrastructure projects face chronic funding challenges. Grant cycles don't match software maintenance needs. The work that keeps things running is often invisible. Solving this isn't just about Galaxy - it's about how we fund critical digital infrastructure.

## Current Thinking

Sustainability requires multiple approaches:

1. **Diversified funding** - Not dependent on any single grant or funder
2. **Community investment** - Users who benefit should contribute
3. **Institutional partnerships** - Organizations that depend on Galaxy have incentive to support it
4. **Demonstrated value** - Clear metrics on impact and usage

The challenge: the people who benefit most often have the least ability to pay.

## Open Subquestions

- How do we make the case for infrastructure funding vs. novel research?
- What business models work for open source scientific software?
- How do we balance commercial partnerships with open source values?
- How do we measure and communicate impact to funders?
