## The Question

What should one do in Pittsburgh?

## Why It Matters

Pittsburgh is an underrated city with world-class food, drinks, and culture. Knowing where to go - and where to skip - makes the difference between a good visit and a great one. After years here, I have opinions.

## Current Thinking

See my [Best of Pittsburgh awards](/best-of-pittsburgh) for specific recommendations.

Pittsburgh excels at:

1. **Cocktail bars** - Seriously good craft cocktail scene
2. **Neighborhood restaurants** - Skip downtown, explore the neighborhoods
3. **Outdoor spaces** - More parks than you'd expect
4. **Quirky attractions** - Mattress Factory, Randyland, etc.

## Open Subquestions

- What newcomers consistently overlook?
- How do the neighborhoods differ in character?
- What's worth the trip outside the city?
- How does the food scene compare to other cities?
