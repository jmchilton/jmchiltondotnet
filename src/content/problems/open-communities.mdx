## The Question

How do we build and enable open communities?

## Why It Matters

Open source software powers the modern world, but most projects fail not from technical problems but from community problems. Building software is hard; building communities that sustain and improve software over decades is harder. The projects that succeed create something larger than any individual contributor.

## Current Thinking

Healthy open communities share characteristics:

1. **Low barriers to entry** - First contributions should be achievable
2. **Clear governance** - Decision-making processes people can understand
3. **Recognition systems** - Contributors feel valued
4. **Distributed ownership** - No single point of failure (or burnout)

The challenge is that these things are easier to describe than to implement.

## Open Subquestions

- How do we balance openness with quality control?
- What governance models scale beyond the founding team?
- How do we prevent burnout among core maintainers?
- How do we make communities welcoming without lowering standards?
