## The Question

How do we enable researchers to do analyses in usable, accessible web interfaces at scale?

## Why It Matters

Computational research increasingly requires serious computing power, but most researchers aren't systems administrators. The gap between "I have data" and "I have answers" shouldn't require a computer science degree to cross. Web interfaces can democratize access to computational tools, but only if they actually work at scale.

## Current Thinking

The challenge is multi-dimensional:

1. **Usability** - Interfaces that don't require training to use
2. **Scale** - Handling real datasets, not toy examples
3. **Accessibility** - Working for researchers with varying technical backgrounds
4. **Reliability** - Long-running analyses that don't lose work

Galaxy has proven this is possible, but the space for improvement is vast.

## Open Subquestions

- How do we balance power-user features with newcomer accessibility?
- What's the right abstraction level for exposing computational complexity?
- How do we handle the inherent tension between flexibility and simplicity?
- How do we make failure modes understandable to non-technical users?
