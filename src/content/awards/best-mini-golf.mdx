## The Winner: Puttshack

[Puttshack](https://www.puttshack.com/locations/pittsburgh/) takes the crown for best mini-golf in Pittsburgh. Located at The Terminal in the Strip District, it delivers a more vibrant and fun experience than the competition.

## The Runner-Up: Puttery

[Puttery](https://www.puttery.com/locations/pittsburgh/) deserves recognition for its diverse aesthetics across three themed courses (the Lodge, the Library, and the Garage). It makes for a great date spot with its chic vibe and craft cocktails.

## Why Puttshack Wins

While Puttery has style, Puttshack brings more energy. The atmosphere is more vibrant, the tech-infused gameplay keeps things interesting, and it's just plain more fun. If you're looking for a lively night out with friends or a memorable date, Puttshack edges ahead.
