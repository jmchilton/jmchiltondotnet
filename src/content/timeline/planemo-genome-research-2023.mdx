**Published**: February 2023

**DOI**: 10.1101/gr.276963.122

## Research Overview

This paper presents Planemo as a comprehensive toolkit that addresses the complexity of integrating command-line software utilities into Galaxy's web-based interface. It demonstrates how systematic tooling and best practices can accelerate scientific software development while maintaining quality.

## Key Findings

**Adoption & Impact**: Planemo has achieved significant adoption with **more than 70,000 downloads from both Anaconda and PyPI**, demonstrating its value to the scientific software development community.

**Multi-Domain Functionality**: The toolkit encompasses:

- Galaxy tool development and testing
- Common Workflow Language (CWL) tool creation
- Workflow composition and execution
- Training material development for Galaxy

## Technical Architecture

The paper details Planemo's modular design using two central abstractions:

### Runnables

Tools and workflows that can be executed across different computational environments.

### Engines

External software capable of executing runnables (Galaxy, cwltool, Toil, etc.).

This abstraction layer enables developers to write tools once and execute them across multiple platforms.

## Methodology & Best Practices

Planemo enforces development quality through:

- **Test-driven development**: Requires developers to write test cases before implementation
- **Automated testing**: Built-in test execution against multiple Galaxy versions
- **Linting**: Automated code quality checks and best practice enforcement
- **Continuous integration**: GitHub Actions and other CI workflows
- **Dependency management**: Automated updates for tool dependencies

## Applications

The toolkit enables several advanced workflows:

1. **Automated Dependency Updates**: Keeps tools current with latest software versions
2. **ToolShed Deployment**: Manages tool releases to Galaxy's public tool repository
3. **Programmatic Workflow Execution**: Enables high-throughput analyses via command-line interface
4. **Training Material Integration**: Facilitates creation of interactive tutorials

## Personal Role & Contributions

As a co-author and core contributor to Planemo, my work focused on:

- Designing the "Runnables" and "Engines" abstraction layer
- Implementing Galaxy integration and testing frameworks
- Building deployment automation for the ToolShed
- Contributing to workflow execution capabilities
- Documentation and community engagement

The test-driven development approach was particularly important to me - by requiring test cases upfront, we created more robust tools and caught issues early in development.

## Impact on Scientific Computing

Planemo has become essential infrastructure for the Galaxy ecosystem, enabling:

- **Faster tool development cycles** through automation
- **Higher quality tools** through enforced testing
- **Broader accessibility** by lowering the barrier to tool creation
- **Reproducible research** through standardized tool definitions
- **Cross-platform compatibility** via CWL support

## Research Significance

This paper documents how systematic tooling can transform scientific software development. Rather than ad-hoc tool creation, Planemo provides a structured, tested, documented pathway from command-line utility to production-ready Galaxy tool.

The success of this approach - evidenced by 70,000+ downloads - demonstrates that the scientific community values tools that enforce best practices while reducing development friction.

## Future Directions

The paper positions Planemo as a foundation for:

- Enhanced workflow composition interfaces
- Improved training material generation
- Broader CWL ecosystem integration
- Advanced testing and validation capabilities
