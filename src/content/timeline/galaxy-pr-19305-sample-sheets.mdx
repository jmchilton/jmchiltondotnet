## The Pull Request

This PR implements sample sheets for Galaxy, addressing a critical gap in how users manage complex metadata that traditional list structures can't capture. Sample sheets enable structured, validated metadata alongside scientific datasets.

## The Problem

Scientific workflows often require rich metadata about samples that simple lists can't represent. Researchers need:

- Column-based metadata structures with validation
- Integration with external spreadsheet tools (Excel, Google Sheets)
- Clear, intuitive interfaces for metadata entry
- Seamless workflow integration

## Technical Implementation

The solution provides multiple pathways for sample sheet creation and use:

### Core Features

- **New collection input type** for workflow editors supporting sample sheet definitions
- **UI wizard** for creating sample sheet collections from various sources
- **Conversion tool** for transforming sample sheets to tabular format within workflows
- **"Apply Rules" integration** for direct processing using model objects
- **Cell validation** with column descriptions displayed as tooltips

### User Experience

The implementation balances power with accessibility:

- Create sample sheets directly in Galaxy's workflow editor
- Import from external spreadsheet programs
- Generate from existing collections
- Real-time validation feedback
- Responsive design for various display sizes

## Impact & Adoption

**Status**: Merged (July 30, 2025)

**Milestone**: 25.1

**Labels**: area/API, area/dataset-collections, area/UI-UX, area/workflows, highlight, kind/feature

This feature fundamentally expands Galaxy's capability to handle complex experimental designs, particularly important for:

- Multi-sample experiments with varied conditions
- Clinical/biomedical workflows requiring patient metadata
- Integration with external LIMS systems
- Reproducible research documentation

## Personal Notes

Sample sheets represent a significant UI/UX challenge - how do you make complex metadata management intuitive? The multi-pathway approach (wizard, direct editing, spreadsheet import) ensures users can work in their preferred method.

The integration with "Apply Rules" was particularly satisfying - it leverages existing Galaxy functionality while extending it to handle richer data structures. Several refinements during review addressed responsive design and language clarity, resulting in a more polished final implementation.

This work demonstrates the value of thinking beyond traditional bioinformatics interfaces to support real-world research workflows.

## Technical Highlights

- Multiple refinements based on community feedback
- Responsive design considerations for smaller displays
- Careful UX language to guide users through complex operations
- Tight integration with existing Galaxy collection and workflow systems
