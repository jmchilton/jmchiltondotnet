## Hogna Wolf Spider

Wolf spiders are unique in the way that they carry their eggs. The egg sac, a round, silken globe, is attached to the spinnerets at the end of the abdomen, allowing the spider to carry her unhatched young with her. The abdomen must be held in a raised position to keep the egg case from dragging on the ground. Despite this handicap, they are still capable of hunting. Another aspect unique to wolf spiders is their method of care of young. Immediately after the spiderlings emerge from their protective silken case, they clamber up their mother's legs and crowd onto the dorsal side of her abdomen. The mother carries the spiderlings for several weeks before they are large enough to disperse and fend for themselves. No other spiders are currently known to carry their young on their backs for any period of time.

## Scorpion-Tailed Spider

The tails are only present on females, but unlike the common names suggests, these spiders aren't related to scorpions. They curl up their tails when disturbed, but they are completely harmless. Bites are rare, and result in minor symptoms such as local pain and swelling. They stay at the middle of their web day and night, and their bodies mimic plant litter, such as fallen flowers, twigs, or dead leaves.

## Ogre-Faced Spider

Spiders in the genus Deinopis catch their prey in an unusual fashion. They first spin a small upright rectangular cribellate web. This is then detached from its supporting threads and held horizontally above the ground by the spider's long front two pairs of legs while the spider hangs almost vertically. Passing prey is then captured by dropping the "net" over it.

## Ladybird Mimic Spider

The Ladybird Mimic Spider has a body that looks just like the ladybug, which has given it its common name. These small spiders are around 5-6 mm (0.19-0.23 in) long and are native to China, Japan, and Taiwan.

## Red-Backed Jumping Spider

The red-backed jumping spider has a black cephalothorax and orange-red abdomen. In addition, the female red-backed jumping spider has an identifiable black abdominal stripe. These black and orange spiders measure 0.35" to 0.55" (9 – 14 mm) long. Thus, this species is one of the larger types of jumping spiders.

The red-backed jumping spider is a type of tubular web-spinning spider. The black and red furry spider weaves a silken nest where it hides and lays eggs. Although these spiders can look menacing and bite, they are relatively harmless to humans and make good pets.

## Poecilotheria Metallica

Poecilotheria metallica is known to be one of the worlds most colorful and beautiful spiders. It's also known as the gooty sapphire ornamental spider and is found in deciduous forest in Andhra Pradesh, in central southern India.

This is one of the worlds biggest spiders, and can reach a legspan of 20 cm (8 in). They are today critically endangered due to logging, firewood harvesting, and the exotic pet trade.

## Sac Spider

The bite of a common sac spider (Chiracanthium spp.) can be misdiagnosed as a brown recluse spider bite. Injuries develop in a similar manner but are much less severe. Reactions, such as swelling, slow healing, and ulcerated sores around the bite site, are similar enough to be confusing. If you are bitten by a spider, ice and elevate the bite site. Seek medical attention if the symptoms persist or intensify.

## Spiny-Backed Orb-Weaver

Gasteracantha (known as spiny-backed orb-weavers, spiny orb-weavers, or spiny spiders) is a genus of orb-weaver spiders. Spiny-backed orb-weavers are sometimes colloquially called "crab spiders" because of their shape, but they are not closely related to the true crab spiders. Other colloquial names for certain species include thorn spider, star spider, kite spider, or jewel spider. Members of the genus exhibit strong sexual dimorphism. Males are several times smaller than females, and they lack prominent spines or bright colors.
